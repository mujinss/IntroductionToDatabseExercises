# IntroductionToDatabseExercises

Those files are my exercise records of the open course [_Introduction to Database_](https://class.stanford.edu/courses/Engineering/db/2014_1/info) on stanford online edx platform. 

The records are just used as a backup copy. They are not necessary right. 
People who are taking the course should obey the policy honor code and avoid seeking for answers here.
